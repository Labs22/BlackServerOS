documentation coming soon.

this will only work on linux (it uses ptrace). feel free to port to other platforms.

to install please see INSTALL


quirks:

some apps like Acrobat and RealPlayer are really shell scripts that set special environment variables before launching the
actual binary. be aware of this, it's easy to get around.

RealPlayer:
HELIX_PATH must be set, and realplay.bin must be used as the binary.

Adobe Acrobat:
first invoke the shell script with -DEBUG, then run from there. the actual binary
is usually in Adobe/Acrobat7.0/Reader/intellinux/bin/acroread
