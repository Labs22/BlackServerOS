A Crypton Client SDK for use with Crypton.io will be available with a
free commercial and noncommercial license.  This is suitable for
including SpiderOak hosted Crypton.IO storage options within another
application.  This is similar to using the Dropbox SDK and API to store data
within end users' Dropbox accounts.

There are additional options if you want to build a zero knowledge application
that is entirely self hosted.  In other words, it does not have any dependency
on users having SpiderOak.com accounts.  Rather, you want to operate the
server-side components of Cryton.IO yourself, letting clients connect to your
own infrastructure.

For this, there are two choices.  If your online service is also free and open
source software like Crypton itself, then you may freely make use of the full
Crypton code base including all server components under the terms of
the [AGPL][1].  If making your product free and open source software is
unpalatable, you may instead purchase a commercial server license from SpiderOak.

Many people will say we should make Crypton server available under a more liberal
license than AGPLv3.  Essentially, these people ask for the freedom to build
closed source commercial online services with Crypton without contributing
their own improvements back to the community, without giving credit to the
community's efforts, and without financially supporting the cost of ongoing
maintenance, development, and security review of Crypton.

Such uses are more appropriate under a commercial license.  Early adopters may
receive complimentary commercial licenses.  Contact us.  We have a history of
making reasonable arrangements for startups.
